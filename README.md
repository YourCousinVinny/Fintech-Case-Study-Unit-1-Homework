# Plaid, An Adventure to the Future of Finance

## **Money & Computers** 
In 1792 the United States Congress's Coinage Act was the beginning of the US Dollar. It was a standard currency of which allowed easier consistent trading of items that bartering couldn't match. When enough money was accrued people would keep it in safes, mattresses, or in the banking system. Adam Barone with Investopedia defines a bank as a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes (Barone). Fast forward to the 1950’s and computers began to be introduced as a way to streamline the banking system. As the computers became more efficient so did their applications into the banking world. Public trading benefited greatly from the advancement of computers; going so far as to measure the length of data cables within the servers of the stock exchange as to not give an advantage to anyone due to latency caused by cable length. With the invention of smartphones, banking came to your pocket and was with you anywhere you had a cellphone signal. As credit cards gained popularity, carrying cash was not as popular of an option due to security and basic conventionality. Even pooling together money for a night of going to the bar turned into a “i'll get this round” situation. Beyond that, people liked to have more access with their banking information via third party applications. The phones had become smarter but the banking system seemed content with their integration with technology.

## Solving a Small Problem, In a Big Way.

Perret, a Duke graduate and board of trustees member along with Hockey, an Emory grad who worked on Open Study; A social media learning tool, came together at Bain and Company. While rooming together as a result of being colleagues both were bothered by the lack of transparency in their bills. Their solution? Create an app that shows all of your financial movements as a live feed. The idea of creating a consumer finance app was halted by the lack of support for connecting the end user to their respective financial service. Initially, the project they came up with to solve this problem was called Rambler. This project was entered in the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon in New York City. Rambler went on to win the hackathon but as a result, what was to be developed was more than just a link between an application on a user's phone and their finances; Perret and Hockey created the infrastructure to allow web developers to build the tools to allow those users to gain a live feed of what is happening within their accounts. The building blocks of Rambler would become the beginning of plaids more popularly used API. (Rooney)

Traditionally, to connect your bank account to a 3rd party application would involve manually entering a user's account information using routing numbers. Once entered the app would make a small deposit, let it clear and then debit that deposit. Not only is it a pain to have to enter your routing number, the process is drawn out across multiple days awaiting the bank to approve the transfer of funds. Plaid's solution, have the bank confirm the user’s account information prior to executing any transactions. The “pipeline” Plaid has created keeps the user’s bank account and 3rd party application connected by creating a new identifier that holds  a unique relation to a user’s sensitive account information without having said information be in open space. This identifier allows the bank to confirm the user while still being able to recognize fraud.  

Plaid’s business model is set up to work with other businesses. The infrastructure that Perret and Hockey have created allows various startups to get a jumpstart in the financial industry without having to dedicate an entire engineering department just to create a solid foundation for a product. With this in mind, majority Plaids customers are businesses that are valued under 50 Million and/or have fewer than 50 employees. Plaid themselves as impactful to the Fintech industry as they are, they have around 500 employees. This size allows them to keep their cost extremely low but does not allow for quite the individual support and custom curated apis that competitors like Stripe Connect, Codat, & MX provide.

## Building on a Strong Foundation 

With their new found success, Perret and Hockey began to gain some traction and some glares from other members of the financial world. Venmo, a peer to peer application allowing users to send or share finances with another user over their cell phone. The software was growing in popularity but lacked a solid connection to an end user's actual bank account. An engineer from Venmo approached the Plaid team in an effort to test how well Venmo would work within their API. Not only was this a success, it proved Plaids API was scalable and was more of interest to developers and investors than their original app was. As news got out to what an easy solution this was for the financial world, new companies (i.e. Acorns, Coinbase, Lending Club, Acorns, ect.) were quick to adopt the new infrastructure. 

With a solid product and a clear demand, it was time for Plaid to gain some funding. During its seed funding plaid had raised 2.8 Million dollars from the likes of Amit Avner who is the founder and CEO of Taykey, David Tisch of Boxgroup, Felicis Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Spark Capital and Zach Weinberg who currently has a long history with tech startups. Just over a year later in November of 2014 Plaid would enter series A funding collecting 12.5 Million dollars. Two years following, in June of 2016 Plain would commence its series B funding raising 44 Million dollars from some larger names in the banking world such as American Express ventures, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and PSP Investments. December of 2018 brought them to new heights with 250 Million dollar investment during their series C funding. With such a quick rise to fame Plaid was gaining more than just investment attention.

## Almost Too Powerful? 

In April of 2021 Plaid received Series D funding. We've raised a $425m Series D financing to help scale our platform to support the massive growth in fintech, and enable the next generation of digital financial services. We brought on new investors Altimeter Capital, Silver Lake, and Ribbit Capital who joined existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, New Enterprise Associates, Spark Capital, and Thrive Capital in this round (Perret 1). Due to the expansive growth of fintech plaid has had their work cut out for them. They are currently working on a single platform that can be integrated in most if not all applications.Early last year, Visa agreed to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion, which at the time was double the San Francisco-based start-up’s previous valuation. The Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that it would limit competition in the payments industry. A few months later, Visa scrapped its takeover efforts. The companies said the decision to end the merger was mutual.Plaid’s technology links bank accounts to fintech apps like Venmo, Robinhood and Coinbase -- all of which have seen eye-popping growth during the pandemic. Plaid added Google and Microsoft as customers last year, and said its customer base grew by 60% in 2020 amid the surge in digital finance (Rooney).
